Execution:
- Class "br.usp.icmc.labes.alvmcyber.Main" starts all servers.

Dependencies:
- JUnit 4
- Apache CXF 2.2.5 (tested - include all jar files in /lib)

Folders:
- src: services classes.
- test: test classes.
- clients: stub classes generated to access the services. 
           I created a different folder to avoid mixing up the classes.
